The school-leaving cohort in each academic year comprises Year 12, 13 and 14 pupils leaving mainstream, grant-aided, post-primary schools. It does not include special or independent schools.\r\nAll school leavers are taken to be in the Age 16+ category.\r\n\r\n2. Ethnic Groups: ‘Other’ includes Irish Travellers. 'White' does not include Irish Travellers.\r\n\r\n3. The dataset is gathered electronically from schools annually in October/ November via the school administration system. As the school leavers data collection and validation process takes place at the start of the subsequent academic year, it is not possible to collect or validate information for pupils who left schools that closed at the end of the academic year being analysed. This would only relate to a small number of pupils, however, if any.\r\n\r\n4. Broadly speaking, each academic year’s cohort of school leavers contains a mix of around one-third of leavers after Key Stage 4 and around two-thirds of leavers after a period of Level 3 study.\r\n\r\n5. Analyses of GCSEs (and equivalent qualifications) will, for example, be a mix of attainment in the most recent academic year (for pupils leaving immediately following Key Stage 4) and attainment from previous academic years (for pupils leaving following a period of Level 3 study). \r\nAs such, the School Leavers Survey cannot be used to analyse examination results, or attainment, achieved in a specific academic year. The School Leavers Survey is, however, appropriate for monitoring the long-term trend of the impact of the Northern Ireland school system on pupil attainment levels.\r\n\r\n6. Includes equivalent qualifications.\r\n\r\n7. Given the alternative methods of awarding grades in 2019/20 and 2020/21, and the various assessment adaptations and other supports in place for 2021/22 and 2022/23, caution should be taken when drawing any conclusions relating to changes in student performance. \r\nYear-on-year changes might have been impacted by the different processes for awarding qualifications in these years rather than reflect a change in underlying performance. \r\nEducation outcomes for school leavers in these affected years are, therefore, not directly comparable with outcomes in any other years (including comparisons with other affected years). \r\n\r\n[u]Generally, the school leavers data for 2019/20 combines[/u]:\r\n- Centre Assessed Grades, for pupils who left the school system after being awarded GCSEs or A-Levels (and equivalent qualifications) in 2019/20; and\r\n- GCSE (and equivalent qualification) results for pupils who sat exams in previous years and who left in 2019/20.\r\n[u]Generally, the data for 2020/21 combines[/u]:\r\n- Centre Determined Grades, for pupils who left the school system after being awarded GCSEs or A-Levels (and equivalent qualifications) in 2020/21; and\r\n- GCSE (and equivalent qualification) results for pupils who sat exams in years prior to 2019/20 and who left in 2020/21.\r\n[u]Generally, the data for 2021/22 combines[/u]:\r\n- Results for pupils who left the school system after being awarded GCSEs or A-Levels (and equivalent qualifications), with various assessment adaptations, in 2021/22.\r\n[u]Generally, the data for 2022/23 combines[/u]:\r\n- Results for pupils who left the school system after being awarded GCSEs or A-Levels (and equivalent qualifications), with additional support (Advance Information), in 2022/23; and\r\n- Centre Determined Grades, for pupils who were awarded GCSEs (and equivalent qualification) in 2020/21 and who left in 2022/23.\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Age\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Age\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: 16+\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Men and women generally\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Sex\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Female; Male\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Marital status\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: These data are not collected by the survey\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Persons with a disability and persons without\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: These data are not collected by the survey\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Religious belief\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Religion\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Catholic; Protestant and other Christian religions; Other; No religion; Religion not stated\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Sexual orientation\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: These data are not collected by the survey\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Persons with dependants and persons without\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: These data are not collected by the survey\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Racial group\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Ethnic Group\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: White; Other\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Political opinion\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: These data are not collected by the survey"};
