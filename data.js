Divorced and Separated have been grouped together due to small sample sizes.\n\nSection 75 category: Persons with a disability and persons without\nVariable used: Disability\nBreakdown available:: Disabled; Not Disabled\n\nDisability status is based on whether someone in the family has a disability / whether no-one in the family has a disability. \n\n‘Disability’ is measured using ‘limiting long-standing illness’. Respondents are defined as having a limiting long standing illness if they have any physical or mental health conditions or illnesses lasting or expected to last for 12 months or more, and the condition(s) or illness(es) reduce their ability to carry out day to day activities. The impairment types changed in 2012/13 therefore disability estimates are not directly comparable with those for years prior to 2012/13. Everyone classified as disabled under the FRS definition would also be classified as disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). However, some individuals classified as disabled and having rights under the DDA would not be captured by this definition.\n\nSection 75 category: Religious belief\nVariable used: Religion\nBreakdown available:: Catholic; Protestant and other Christian religions\n\nReligion is based on the religion of the head of the benefit unit.

Options are: a. Heterosexual/ Straight, b. Gay/ Lesbian, c. Bisexual, d. Other.\n\nStraight or heterosexual is the only group with a large enough sample size.
